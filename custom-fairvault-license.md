# License details

*Last updated: 2025-10-13*

The **Custom FAIRVault license** option applies to datasets where **all files are restricted**. In such cases, there is no openly available content to which an open license can be applied. Instead of a public license, access and use conditions are handled **case by case** when someone requests access.

## What "Custom FAIRVault license" means

When every file in a dataset is restricted, a standard open data license cannot be attached. If access is requested, the terms of use must be defined in a **data sharing** or **data transfer agreement** between the provider and the requester. That agreement serves the role a license would otherwise fill and should clearly describe permitted uses, limitations, and responsibilities.

## Data sharing / transfer agreements (DSA/DTA)

A Data Sharing/Transfer Agreement is a legal contract that:

- **Protects the data provider** by specifying how the data may (and may not) be used.
- **Prevents misunderstandings** by documenting scope, security, privacy, and redistribution rules in writing.

Before releasing restricted files, a DSA/DTA should specify at least:

- The **data covered** (title, version, identifiers, files).
- The **purposes and permitted uses** (e.g., research only, non‑commercial, no attempts at re‑identification, etc.).
- **Access controls and security** measures expected of the recipient.
- **Redistribution and publication** limits (e.g., no onward sharing without written permission).
- **Attribution/acknowledgement** expectations and citation format.
- **Retention and destruction** timelines and processes.
- **Breach handling** and termination conditions.
- **Governing law and venue** (as required by your institution).

> **Signing authority:** Follow your organisation’s internal policies to determine who must sign (e.g., principal investigator, department, tech‑transfer, or legal).

## Requesting access to a restricted dataset

1. **Contact the dataset owner** using the contact details in FAIRVault or the dataset landing page.
2. Provide a short description of your **intended use** and any **ethical/legal approvals** you already hold.
3. The owner (and their institution, where applicable) will **review** the request, draft or provide a **DSA/DTA**, and coordinate signatures.
4. Upon completion, **access will be granted** in accordance with the agreement’s terms.

If you need help, please reach out to your FAIRVault support contact or repository administrator.

## Suggested acknowledgement

If data are shared under a DSA/DTA, include an acknowledgement such as:

> *“This research used restricted data accessed via FAIRVault under a Data Sharing/Transfer Agreement with the data provider. Access was granted for the purposes described in the agreement; further sharing is not permitted.”*

## Notes and compatibility

- "Custom FAIRVault license" is **not** an open license. It’s a **workflow** for handling restricted datasets with bespoke terms.
- If you can make **any subset** of files openly available, consider releasing those specific files under an appropriate **standard license** (e.g., CC BY, CC0) and keep only the sensitive files restricted under DSA/DTA terms.
- Where applicable, align with **institutional policies**, ethical approvals, and applicable **data protection laws**.
