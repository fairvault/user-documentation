# Access

FAIRVault is an instance of Harvard Dataverse, aimed for secure storage of research data. It is presently in pilot status, and hosted at [https://fairvault.dev.ugent.be](https://fairvault.dev.ugent.be). It allows researchers to publish, share, and preserve research data in line with FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).

2. Choose **“Log in via your institution”**.

3. Select your university (UGent, VUB, UHasselt, or UAntwerpen).  

   Using the correct institutional account ensures that you receive the proper permissions automatically.
