<mark><strong>Note that currently the FAIRVault is available for testing purposes only!</strong></mark>

The FAIRVault seeks to provide a generic solution to researchers from participating institutions for **securely archiving and providing (controlled) access** to research data in a FAIR-aligned way during the applicable data retention period, in particular in cases where deposit in one of the existing external data repositories is not or less appropriate or not feasible: e.g. for sensitive data, large datasets, or data not within scope of repository collection policies, in case of lack of trust in external service providers, or of their non-alignment with our local regulatory context...

The FAIRVault thus enables researchers from participating institutions to comply with data preservation, data sharing, FAIR data, and data protection requirements ("as open as possible, as closed as necessary") from institutions, funders, governments and other research stakeholders.

The FAIRVault is a federated service providing participating institutions with maximal control over research data assets under their responsibility, while also leveraging collaboration/coordination for example to pool resources, make use of common architecture, service components and frameworks where possible to increase efficiencies.  

The FAIRVault ensures that research data at least remain intact during their retention period (bit-level preservation), but does not perform  file formation migration, normalization, emulation and similar activities to guarantee future usability.
