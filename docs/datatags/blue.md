# Blue data tag: non-confidential and non-sensitive data

If a dataset can be **openly shared**, without any access restrictions, the dataset can be tagged with a blue data tag.
Anyone browsing to the FAIRVault repository will be able to access the dataset files.

## Example FAIRVault dataset
A researcher conducts chemical analyses on archaeological artefacts in order to study human consumption behaviour in the Middle Ages. The raw data of this study consists of chemical fingerprints of a high amount of samples, resulting in large data volumes which cannot be easily deposited in external data repositories. The interpretation of the results have been published.

## How to classify?

Fill out the the metadata fields relating to the FAIRVault decision tree. This comprises of questions related to the confidentiality of the data.  

- Provide information for the most sensitive data contained in the dataset, for each type of sensitivity. *E.g.: if one file contains personal data and another is important for commercial valorization, both questions should be answered positively.*

If there are no sensitivity or confidentiality risks, the dataset will get a **blue** data tag, and there will be no Legitimate Opt Out reason for open sharing of research data.
- When submitting the dataset for review, the data curators will review the data tag classification.
