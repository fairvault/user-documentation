This page offers a simplified perspective on how to request datasets with a given datatag, and serves as a guide for how to request access for certain types of classified data.

# Blue

Blue Datatagged datasets can be shared freely. No access request or any procedure is necessary.

# Green

Datasets with a green DataTag are automatically accessible to logged in users. In order to access them; create your account, at which point you'll have access. We instead ask for information when the files are downloaded.

1. Fill out the guest book for the dataset when downloading files.

# Orange

Orange Datatagged datasets contain some sensitive data, and as such, are only available after a Data Access Request. Do the following:

1. Request access to restricted files using FAIRVault. This access request is handled by curators and the original data owner.
2. Fill out the guest book for the dataset when downloading files.

# Red

Datasets with a red DataTag are considered to contain highly sensitive data. These often come with specific access conditions, and always with a Data Transfer Agreement.

1. Contact FAIRVault support for this dataset to request access. They will walk you through the process of getting access to this specific dataset.
