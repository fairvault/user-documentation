# Data Access conditions

The different levels of data access conditions are based on the Data Tags principle that was originally developed at Harvard University. These data tags are a tool to quickly assess the sensitivity level of a dataset in a standardized way that is easy to understand for both humans and machines. In its original form, six Data Tags were developed, but for FAIRVault we tailored them to four to be in line with the EOSC-Hub recommendations and to optimize the user-friendliness of the FAIRVault. 

By answering the questions of the [decision tree](decision-forest.md), you and the data curators will end up with the appropriate Data Tag for your deposit in the FAIRVault.
